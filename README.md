<h2>Description</h2>
A client requested our security services after experiencing a company-wide security breach. However, we encountered a significant challenge since our teams were located across different locations in the US. To provide the best possible protection to our client's businesses, we operated across multiple time zones and promptly monitored the various systems. 
<br />
<br />
To address this challenge, I created an Elastic SIEM Lab. This lab environment enables me to connect, monitor, test, and analyze various operating systems remotely across multiple network systems. By utilizing these tools, we can guarantee prompt and effective protection for our client's businesses.
