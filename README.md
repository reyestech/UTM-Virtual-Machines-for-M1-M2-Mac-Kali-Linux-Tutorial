 ### [Fullstack Academy - Capstone Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mizcEhlYScNc8-_g/edit)


<h2>Purpose</h2> 
Our team faced some challenges when setting up our SIEM lab environment. Team members using Apple silicon-based computers encountered difficulties creating virtual machines on their personal computers. We were able to resolve this issue by using UTM, a virtualized environment that is designed for M1 and M2 Macs. This allowed our team members to have Linux distributions on their computers that they could use on the go. We created a tutorial to help other information security professionals and students facing similar issues. 
 
<h2>Tools & Environments Used </h2>

<h2> Description </h2> 
Accessing type 2 hypervisors can be daunting for security professionals and students when deploying Linux distributions on their Apple Mac computers. To add to the complexity, the affordable versions of hypervisors like VMware and VirtualBox can be incompatible, further complicating the access of Linux distributions on Apple Computers. However, there is a solution to this problem - UTM. By leveraging virtualization, UTM can act as a front end to Apple's built-in hypervisor, a macOS feature, allowing us to access Kali Linux - a Debian-based distribution. It's worth noting that these steps can be used to virtualize other Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or RedHat distributions like CentOS.
